:::NOTES:::

Methods:

when we see main- that mean here is where we are starting the exicution. 

In java we create components by creating classes and they come together. 

We create methose by perenthesis:

    void- meaning tiou are not expecting anything in return. 

when you use retuurn in a method. to call it store in a variable in another class-- to print. 


Method overloading is when you have the same name of a method and adding more paramaters or diffterent types.

Refer to replit:

Generics are when you do not specify a specific type until the class is instanciated / called

this is where you use the <> brackets
